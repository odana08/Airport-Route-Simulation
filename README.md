# Airport-Route-Simulation
Built an Airport Route Simulation in Java for a senior computing course. Modeled airports and routes using graphs and HashMaps, and adapted Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to optimize travel by cost, time, and distance. Designed an interactive UI with Java Swing to visualize routes and results.
